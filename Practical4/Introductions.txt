Hello. 
My name is dream (screen name you know).
I like drinking tea and eating chocolates.
I don't like my slow brain. I may need a new one.
hhhhh no. Exactly I will train it to be as flexible as a new one.
I like regular schedules, though obeying them may be a little difficult. I won't give up.
I used to love literature. Now I know it's only some tricks in our brain.
I used to consider literature holy. Now I know the real one is the turth.
I like psychology today. I wanna explore neuroscience in the future.
Abandoning my previous love make me sometimes suffering, but I never regret.
I hope I'm right.
I trust myself.
