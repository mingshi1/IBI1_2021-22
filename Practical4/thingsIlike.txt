I like getting GitHub to work (though I did spend a lot of time adapting to using it)
I like (listening to) music (still trying to ukulele now)
I like tea
I like psychology
I like turth
I don't like literature, although I enjoyed it before. 
I don't like my weakness. I'm training myself to plan, to better control myself, to be a better one.
I don't like too spicy food.
I'm exploring the turth, at least I think. I like doing this.
