Question:
 South Korea, Kenya, and Colombia are three countries in different parts of the world,
but with similar populations. Plot the total number of COVID cases over time in all
three.

Solution begins at line 99 in the covid.py file.

For the result, I get a plot with the 3 countries' datas, where the blue circle represents the South Korea, the red triangle is the Kenya, the green '+' is the Colombia.
From the plot, we see that from 2019-12-31 to 2020-02-19, the total cases of South Korea is about 0, form 2020-02-19 to 2020-03-09, its total cases grows sharply to about 8000, then it grows more slowly until 2020-03-31 where the total cases was about 10000.
For Kenya, the data begins at 2020-03-07, then grows slowly to around 800 at 2020-03-31.
For Colombia, the data begins at 2020-03-14, keep the value at 0 or so then.

So, the result indicates that although the 3 countries have same population, the total cases of COVTD-19 differ. It's clear showed the pandemic was muc more serious in South Korea at 2020-03-31. While in the Kenya, it was less severe in Kenya, and almost can't be found in Colombia.
Since the plot only shows the situation before 2020-03-31, when the pandemic haven't spread entirely. The different pandemic may be caused by the distance between the country and the headstream.
